# Programming Education Assistant

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/prog-edu-assistant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/prog-edu-assistant)

A project to create a suite of programming assignments
that can be used for running a college-level programming
course. The tools provided in this repository make it easier
to author new assignments as Jupyter notebooks,
automatically generate the student version of the assingment
notebooks, and provide the server-side auto-checking for
student notebooks.

The main focus is Japanese universities, so the assignments
text may be developed or translated to Japanese language.

## Student workflow

The followint student workflow is intended for the programming
assignments included with this project:

1. The student installs the client-side environment, including
   Python 3, Jupyter notebook and a custom extension provided
   by this project. This can be done using Virtualenv or
	 Conda.

2. For each unit of the course, the student downloads the
   Jupyter notebook with course material about 1 week in
   advance of the class.

3. The student reads the description of the assignment within
   the notebook, runs examples and completes the task inside
   the notebook.

4. The student presses the "Check" menu item in the notebook
   to upload the notebook to the backend system. The backend
   system stores the notebook in temporary storage and runs
   a few automated checks, including syntax and style checker
   and runtime tests for the assignment. The result of
   the checks are formatted as an HTML page and the URL
	 is passed back to the browser running on student computer
	 and shown in a new tab.

6. The student modifies the solution to address the comments
   and runs the check again until they are satisfied.

7. The final submission of the assignment notebook is currently
   out of scope of this project.

## Architecture

This project consists of the following components:

* Programming assignments in the form of Jupyter notebooks
  (master notebooks). Notebooks include a few tests, which may
	be preserved or omitted in the student version of the assignment
	notebook. The key idea is that the master notebook is
	fully self-sufficient, and successful running from top to bottom
	indicates that all tests pass.

* The student version of the assignment notebooks are automatically
  generated from the master notebook. Some of the tests are
	provided for the students to check their solution, typically
	in the form of cells with a few assertions.

* The tests defined in the master notebooks are also extracted
  into a stand-alone autochecking suite that can be run on server.
  The results of the test run are collected in outcome map
	and used to render a report from a template. The rendered
	template is returned to student in the form of a web page.

* This project provides a Jupyter notebook extension to add
  a `Check` button to the Jupyter notebook that allows to
	upload the complete assignment notebook to the autochecking
	server.

* The web server that accepts the notebook uploads and
  schedules checker runs, and reports the results back.

* The server backend that runs scheduled checkers (worker).
  The worker and the web server use a message queue to communicate.
