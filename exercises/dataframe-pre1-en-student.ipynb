However, for the programmatic access, a simpler format may be even more useful.\n","It is easy to generate, even by typing manually, and relatively easy to parse. CSV stands for comma-separated values, so it uses a comma `,` to separate the values in a single row.\n","\n","CSV format has several detailed definitions which may disagree in small details, but it is possible to stick\n","to a conservative set of rules serving as a minimum common denominator and being highly interoperable. Here are the conservative rules:\n","\n","* Every line has the same number of fields separated by commas. In CSV speak, each line is called \"a record\".\n","* The values of fields should not contain commas or newline characters. In a rare event that comma needs to be a part of the value, the field value should be enclosed in double quotes. (If the contents of the field needs to contain double quote character itself, it should be doubled inside, but this quickly gets dangerous in a sense that the details of escaping rules may differ between different programs working with CSV files).\n","* The first line in the file optionally may be a header, i.e. contain the human-readable column names.\n","\n","Typically the CSV format is used in files with `.csv` suffix, but Python language makes it easy enough to parse CSV defined in string literals. This in fact may be the easiest way to define small data frames in Jupyter notebooks. Here is an example.

The variable names should be in column header only, i.e. variable names should never occur in field values.\n","* Variable (columns) can be subdivided into _controlled_ (how we set up an experiment), and _measured_ (the values that we are measuring). This way of thinking explains what do we mean by each row corresponding to one observation.\n","\n","All other possible formats of data that are not tidy are called _messy_ by contrast.\n","\n","There is some connection of tidy data frames to 3rd normal form in the database theory, but data frames tend to be more flexible and malleable. It is also worth noting, that depending on the purpose of data analysis and required computations, the definition of \"one observation\" may be different. For example, let's assume that we have the data about flight arrival and departure times. If we want to study flight lengths, then it is convenient to have departure and arrival as independent variables in separate columns, which makes it really easy to compute flight length. If on the other hand we want to study the distribution of how the air stripe is used, then depatures and arrivals are just timestamps of events, and arrival/departure is better to be thought of an additional categorical variable.\n","\n","\n","There are two benefits to tidy data frames\n","\n","* Bringing all data into tidy frame format makes your life easier as you do not need\n","  to remember and handle various data format pecularities. Data handing becomes much more\n","  uniform.\n","  \n","* There is an existing set of tools that work best when the data is in tidy format.
