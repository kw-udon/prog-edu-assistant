# Design of autograder interface

A worker daemon is started inside a container that is crafted to provide
a limited environment for running python code. Additional isolation
is provided by nsjail.

Autograder scripts are built in advance and shipped inside the worker
container image. The matching of the submitted Jupyter notebook to
the autograder scripts is made by using metadata embedded in the Jupyter
notebook.
