# Autograder

This directory contains a few examples of various pieces of autograder scripts.

* `unittest/` --- tests based on Python unittest library.
* `syntax/` --- tests based on syntax parsing and regexps matching.
* `extract/` --- an example of extracting the submitted code from Jupyter
  notebook.

Note that the files in this directory are examples only.
The autograder scripts for production deployment will be
extracted from master assignment notebooks rather than copied
from this directory.
